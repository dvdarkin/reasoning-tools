# Resolving Conflicts

How to navigate disagreements and competitive situations.

## Overview

Conflict resolution requires understanding interests vs positions, finding positive-sum solutions, managing escalation, and sometimes accepting strategic competition. The tools below help you navigate both cooperative and adversarial conflicts.

## Relevant Tools

### From Game Theory (Competitive)

- **Nash Equilibrium**: Identify stable outcomes where no party benefits from changing strategy alone

- **Backward Induction**: Solve conflicts by reasoning backward from potential end-states
  - Link: [domains/08-conflict-competition/game-theory-competitive.md](../../domains/08-conflict-competition/game-theory-competitive.md#backward-induction)

- **Commitment Devices**: Make credible promises or threats by limiting your own options

### From Litigation Strategy

- **BATNA Analysis**: Identify "best alternative to negotiated agreement" to know your walkaway point

- **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA)**: Find overlap between parties' acceptable outcomes

### From Military Strategy

- **De-escalation Offramps**: Design opportunities to step back before commitment becomes irreversible
  - Link: [domains/08-conflict-competition/military-strategy.md](../../domains/08-conflict-competition/military-strategy.md#destruction-vs-exhaustion)

- **Asymmetric Response**: Counter where opponent is weak rather than meeting strength with strength
  - Link: [domains/08-conflict-competition/military-strategy.md](../../domains/08-conflict-competition/military-strategy.md#asymmetric-advantage)

### From Constitutional Design

- **Mediation Mechanisms**: Create neutral third parties to facilitate resolution
  - Link: [domains/06-coordination-cooperation/constitutional-design.md](../../domains/06-coordination-cooperation/constitutional-design.md#transparency-and-monitoring-mechanisms)

- **Procedural Justice**: Ensure process fairness even when outcome disappoints some parties
  - Link: [domains/06-coordination-cooperation/constitutional-design.md](../../domains/06-coordination-cooperation/constitutional-design.md#procedural-legitimacy)

### From Classical Rhetoric

- **Stasis Theory**: Identify the actual point of disagreement (fact, definition, quality, policy)

### From Distributive Justice

- **Fairness Principles**: Apply equity, equality, or need-based distribution depending on context
  - Link: [domains/09-resource-allocation/distributive-justice.md](../../domains/09-resource-allocation/distributive-justice.md#procedural-vs-substantive-fairness)

- **Veil of Ignorance**: Design solutions without knowing which position you'll occupy

### From Social Psychology

- **Perspective-Taking**: Explicitly model the other party's beliefs, goals, and constraints
  - Link: [domains/02-persuasion-influence/social-psychology.md](../../domains/02-persuasion-influence/social-psychology.md#situation-first-attribution)

- **Reducing Identity Threat**: Frame disagreement about ideas, not about people's competence or values

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Identify stasis point**: Where exactly do positions diverge? (fact, definition, quality, policy?)
2. **Separate interests from positions**: What do parties actually need vs what they demand?
3. **Determine BATNA**: What happens if no agreement is reached?
4. **Find ZOPA**: Is there overlap between acceptable outcomes?
5. **Generate options**: Brainstorm solutions that might satisfy both parties' interests
6. **Apply fairness principles**: Use appropriate justice criterion (equity, equality, need)
7. **Consider commitment devices**: How can parties make agreements credible?
8. **Design de-escalation**: Build in opportunities to step back if tensions rise
9. **Ensure procedural fairness**: Make process transparent and unbiased even if outcome favors one side

## Example Application

**Scenario**: Two teams competing for limited budget at organization.

1. **Stasis**: Policy-level disagreement about resource allocation priorities
2. **Interests vs positions**:
   - Team A position: "We need $500K for feature X"
   - Team A interest: Deliver customer value, avoid team layoffs
   - Team B position: "We need $500K for infrastructure"
   - Team B interest: Prevent technical debt disaster, advance careers
3. **BATNA**:
   - Team A: Small incremental funding, can limp along
   - Team B: Work with legacy systems, increasing maintenance burden
4. **ZOPA**: Total budget is $600K, so some creative split might work
5. **Option generation**:
   - Split 50/50 ($300K each)
   - Phase approach (A gets Q1-Q2, B gets Q3-Q4)
   - Combined proposal (infrastructure enables feature, joint project)
   - Shared services (both use common infrastructure investment)
6. **Fairness**: Equity principle - allocate based on expected ROI; or equality - split evenly
7. **Commitment**: Both teams commit to quarterly milestones with funding contingent on progress
8. **De-escalation**: Monthly check-ins to adjust allocation if priorities shift
9. **Process**: Executive committee makes decision based on transparent criteria

**Outcome**: Joint proposal where Team B builds infrastructure that enables Team A's feature, $400K to infrastructure with $200K to feature development, shared success metrics.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Positional bargaining**: Fighting over stated positions rather than exploring underlying interests
- **Win-lose framing**: Assuming conflict is zero-sum when positive-sum solutions might exist
- **Ignoring BATNA**: Accepting bad deals or rejecting good ones due to poor outside option assessment
- **Premature escalation**: Increasing stakes before exploring cooperative solutions
- **Fairness neglect**: Imposing solutions that work but feel unfair, creating resentment
- **Identity fusion**: Treating disagreement about ideas as attack on person
- **No credible commitment**: Making promises without mechanisms to enforce them
- **Wrong stasis**: Arguing about policy when parties disagree about basic facts
- **Single-issue focus**: Failing to find tradeoffs across multiple issues
