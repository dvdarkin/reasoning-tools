# Learning Skills

How to acquire expertise efficiently and effectively.

## Overview

Skill acquisition requires deliberate practice, structured feedback, mental model building, and progression from novice to expert. The tools below help you learn faster, overcome plateaus, and develop genuine mastery.

## Relevant Tools

### From Learning Theory

- **Deliberate Practice**: Focus on challenging tasks just beyond current ability with immediate feedback

- **Spaced Repetition**: Review material at increasing intervals to optimize retention
  - Link: [domains/05-skill-mastery/learning-theory.md](../../domains/05-skill-mastery/learning-theory.md)

- **Interleaving**: Mix different types of practice rather than blocking same-type repetitions
  - Link: [domains/05-skill-mastery/learning-theory.md](../../domains/05-skill-mastery/learning-theory.md)

- **Retrieval Practice**: Test yourself actively rather than passively reviewing

### From Expertise Studies

- **Chunking**: Organize knowledge into meaningful patterns that can be recognized instantly

- **Mental Model Building**: Develop rich causal models of how the domain works

- **Pattern Recognition**: Train to instantly recognize common situations and appropriate responses

### From Sports Science

- **Progressive Overload**: Gradually increase difficulty to drive adaptation
  - Link: [domains/05-skill-mastery/sports-science.md](../../domains/05-skill-mastery/sports-science.md)

- **Specificity Principle**: Practice closely matches the target performance context
  - Link: [domains/05-skill-mastery/sports-science.md](../../domains/05-skill-mastery/sports-science.md)

- **Recovery Periodization**: Alternate intense practice with recovery to prevent burnout and enable consolidation
  - Link: [domains/05-skill-mastery/sports-science.md](../../domains/05-skill-mastery/sports-science.md)

### From Design Thinking

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Build quick attempts to learn from failure
  - Link: [domains/03-creative-generation/design-thinking.md](../../domains/03-creative-generation/design-thinking.md)

### From Bayesian Statistics

- **Proportional Belief Updating**: Update skill understanding based on evidence from practice
  - Link: [domains/01-decision-under-uncertainty/bayesian-statistics.md](../../domains/01-decision-under-uncertainty/bayesian-statistics.md)

### From Experimental Design

- **Controlled Comparison**: Isolate what works by varying one element at a time

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Assess current level**: Identify what you can already do and where you struggle
2. **Build mental models**: Understand the underlying principles, not just procedures
3. **Identify practice targets**: Choose skills just beyond current ability (deliberate practice)
4. **Design specific practice**: Match practice closely to target performance context
5. **Progressive overload**: Gradually increase difficulty as competence grows
6. **Interleave variety**: Mix different sub-skills rather than blocking repetitions
7. **Get immediate feedback**: Arrange for rapid knowledge of results
8. **Use retrieval practice**: Test yourself actively rather than reviewing passively
9. **Space repetitions**: Review at increasing intervals
10. **Periodize recovery**: Alternate intense practice with consolidation time

## Example Application

**Scenario**: Learning to program in a new language (e.g., Python).

1. **Assess**: Know JavaScript but not Python; understand variables/loops but not list comprehensions
2. **Mental models**: Understand Python's philosophy (explicit, readable), memory model, object system
3. **Practice targets**:
   - Week 1: Basic syntax, data structures
   - Week 2: List comprehensions, generators
   - Week 3: Object-oriented patterns
   - Week 4: Standard library modules
4. **Specific practice**: Build small projects similar to real work (web scraper, data analyzer)
5. **Progressive overload**: Start with guided tutorials, move to building from scratch, then optimize
6. **Interleaving**: Mix syntax practice with algorithm implementation with library usage
7. **Feedback**:
   - Run code frequently to catch errors immediately
   - Use linter for style feedback
   - Code review from experienced Python developer
8. **Retrieval**: Write code from memory rather than copying examples; explain concepts without notes
9. **Spacing**:
   - Review syntax daily for first week
   - Review advanced concepts every 3 days
   - Review older material weekly
10. **Recovery**: Take breaks between intense coding sessions; let concepts consolidate overnight

## Common Pitfalls

- **Passive consumption**: Reading/watching without active practice
- **Comfort zone practice**: Repeating what you can already do
- **Blocked practice**: Doing 50 reps of the same thing instead of mixing variety
- **Immediate repetition**: Reviewing material right after learning instead of spacing
- **No feedback**: Practicing without knowing if you're doing it correctly
- **Ignoring fundamentals**: Jumping to advanced topics without solid foundation
- **No mental models**: Memorizing procedures without understanding principles
- **Burnout**: Continuous intense practice without recovery periods
- **Isolated skills**: Learning sub-skills without integrating them
- **Measuring input not output**: Tracking hours studied rather than performance improvement
