# Coordinating Groups

How to align people toward collective goals despite individual incentives.

## Overview

Coordination requires aligning incentives, establishing common knowledge, managing information flow, and creating commitment mechanisms. The tools below help groups work together effectively.

- **Commander's Intent**: Share purpose and desired end-state, not just orders

### From Operations Research

- **Critical Path Analysis**: Identify sequence of dependent tasks that determines minimum completion time

### From Network Science

- **Centrality Measures**: Identify key coordination nodes in communication networks

- **Small-World Networks**: Design communication structures with high clustering and short paths

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Define collective goal**: What outcome requires coordination?
2. **Map individual incentives**: What does each participant want?
3. **Design incentive compatibility**: Align individual and collective interests
4. **Establish common knowledge**: Ensure everyone knows the plan and that others know it too
5. **Clarify roles**: Define who does what and who decides what
6. **Create commitment mechanisms**: Make defection costly through upfront investment
7. **Set up information flow**: Design communication structure (who talks to whom)
8. **Build psychological safety**: Enable honest communication without fear
9. **Monitor and adjust**: Track coordination quality and refine mechanisms

## Example Application

**Scenario**: Coordinating a cross-functional product launch across engineering, marketing, and sales.

1. **Goal**: Successful product launch with technical quality, market awareness, and sales readiness
2. **Individual incentives**:
   - Engineering: Ship quality code on time, avoid blame for bugs
   - Marketing: Generate buzz, get credit for success
   - Sales: Have sellable product, not be surprised by features
3. **Incentive alignment**:
   - Share success metrics across teams (revenue growth)
   - Require sign-off from all three teams before launch
   - Make delays visible to all (no one can hide problems)
4. **Common knowledge**: Weekly all-hands showing timeline, blockers, dependencies
5. **Roles**:
   - Product manager: Final launch decision
   - Engineering lead: Technical readiness
   - Marketing lead: Campaign timing
   - Sales lead: Sales enablement
6. **Commitment**:
   - Engineering commits resources two months before launch
   - Marketing pre-books advertising spend
   - Sales makes promises to key customers
7. **Information flow**:
   - Daily engineering-product standup
   - Weekly cross-functional sync
   - Slack channel for urgent issues
8. **Psychological safety**:
   - No-blame culture for raising risks early
   - Reward transparency over optimism
9. **Monitoring**:
   - Track dependency completion
   - Survey team satisfaction with coordination
   - Retrospective after launch

## Common Pitfalls

- **Misaligned incentives**: Rewarding individual success over collective outcomes
- **Unclear authority**: No one knows who makes final decisions
- **Information silos**: Teams don't know what others know or are doing
- **No commitment mechanism**: People can defect without cost
- **Role overlap**: Multiple people responsible for same task leads to conflict or gaps
- **Ignoring individual rationality**: Expecting people to sacrifice for the group without compensation
- **Over-centralization**: Bottlenecking all decisions through one person
- **No common knowledge**: Everyone thinks others are coordinating differently
- **Punishing bad news**: Creating incentives to hide problems until they explode
