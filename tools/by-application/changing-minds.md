# Changing Minds / Persuading

How to shift beliefs and motivate action in others.

## Overview

Persuasion requires understanding audience beliefs, framing arguments strategically, building credibility, and addressing resistance. The tools below help you construct compelling cases, anticipate objections, and communicate effectively.

## Relevant Tools

### From Classical Rhetoric

- **Ethos-Pathos-Logos**: Combine credibility (ethos), emotional resonance (pathos), and logical argument (logos)

- **Stasis Theory**: Identify the core point of disagreement (fact, definition, quality, policy)

- **Kairos**: Time arguments to match audience readiness and contextual opportunity

### From Social Psychology

- **Reciprocity Principle**: People feel obligated to return favors and concessions

- **Social Proof**: People look to others' behavior to guide their own

- **Foot-in-the-Door**: Secure small commitments before requesting larger ones

- **Framing Effects**: How options are presented dramatically affects choices

### From Game Theory (Signaling)

- **Costly Signaling**: Demonstrate commitment through actions that would be irrational if you didn't believe your claims
  - Link: [domains/02-persuasion-influence/game-theory-signaling.md](../../domains/02-persuasion-influence/game-theory-signaling.md#costly-signal-recognition)

- **Separating Equilibrium**: Structure communication so only those with genuine quality can afford to signal
  - Link: [domains/02-persuasion-influence/game-theory-signaling.md](../../domains/02-persuasion-influence/game-theory-signaling.md#the-separating-equilibrium-test)

### From Bayesian Statistics

- **Prior-Likelihood-Posterior Decomposition**: Help audience distinguish their prior beliefs from new evidence you're providing
  - Link: [domains/01-decision-under-uncertainty/bayesian-statistics.md](../../domains/01-decision-under-uncertainty/bayesian-statistics.md#prior-likelihood-posterior-decomposition)

- **Likelihood Ratio Thinking**: Frame your evidence in terms of how diagnostic it is
  - Link: [domains/01-decision-under-uncertainty/bayesian-statistics.md](../../domains/01-decision-under-uncertainty/bayesian-statistics.md#likelihood-ratio-thinking)

### From Intelligence Analysis

- **Red Team Analysis**: Anticipate and address the strongest counterarguments
  - Link: [domains/07-truth-seeking/logic-critical-thinking.md](../../domains/07-truth-seeking/logic-critical-thinking.md#red-team-analysis)

### From Experimental Design

- **Randomized Controlled Trials**: Present causal evidence that eliminates alternative explanations
  - Link: [domains/07-truth-seeking/experimental-design.md](../../domains/07-truth-seeking/experimental-design.md#controlled-comparison)

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Understand current beliefs**: What's the audience's prior? What's the stasis point?
2. **Build credibility**: Establish ethos through expertise, consistency, or costly signals
3. **Frame strategically**: Present the same facts in ways that highlight desired comparisons
4. **Provide diagnostic evidence**: Offer high likelihood-ratio information
5. **Use social proof**: Show that similar others have already been persuaded
6. **Start small**: Secure minor commitments before major asks
7. **Address objections**: Red-team your own argument and preempt resistance
8. **Time appropriately**: Match argument to audience readiness (kairos)

## Example Application

**Scenario**: Convincing management to adopt a new software tool.

1. **Current beliefs**: Management skeptical of new tools (prior), disagree about ROI (stasis)
2. **Build credibility**: Share track record of successful past recommendations (ethos)
3. **Frame**: Present as "reducing wasted time" vs "adopting new tool" (loss framing)
4. **Evidence**: Provide case study from similar company (high likelihood ratio)
5. **Social proof**: Show that 3 peer companies already use it
6. **Start small**: Propose pilot program with one team (foot-in-door)
7. **Address objections**: Preemptively answer "too expensive" and "training time" concerns
8. **Timing**: Present right after quarterly review showing productivity issues (kairos)

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ethos neglect**: Leading with logos while lacking credibility
- **Evidence overload**: Providing 20 weak arguments instead of 3 strong ones
- **Ignoring priors**: Presenting evidence without understanding audience starting beliefs
- **False signals**: Making claims without costly commitment to back them up
- **Premature big ask**: Requesting major commitment without building up
- **Frame mismatch**: Using gain framing when audience is risk-averse (or vice versa)
- **Wrong stasis**: Arguing about quality when audience disputes basic facts
