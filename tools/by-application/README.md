# Tools by Application

Problem-oriented guides showing which reasoning tools to apply for common challenges.

## Overview

This directory organizes reasoning tools by the type of problem you're trying to solve, rather than by their domain of origin. Each guide maps relevant tools from across all 32 domains to a specific application area.

These are practical, workflow-oriented guides designed to answer: "I need to do X - which tools should I use and in what order?"

## How to Use These Guides

1. **Start with your problem**: Identify which application category best matches your situation
2. **Read the relevant guide**: Understand the recommended workflow and key tools
3. **Follow the links**: Click through to detailed tool descriptions in domain files
4. **Apply the workflow**: Use the suggested sequence of tools for your specific case
5. **Watch for pitfalls**: Be aware of common mistakes in that application area

## Relationship to Other Indexes

- **[By Domain](../../domains/)**: Organized by field of origin (Economics, Psychology, etc.)
- **[By Tool Name](../by-tool-name/)**: Alphabetical index of individual tools
- **[Matrix View](../../matrix.md)**: Visual map of problem domains × disciplinary approaches

## Contributing

These guides are living documents. As new domains are extracted and tools are added, the application guides will be updated to incorporate relevant new techniques.

## Limitations

- **Artificial boundaries**: Real problems often span multiple application categories
- **Western bias**: Tools primarily from formal academic traditions; contemplative and craft traditions underrepresented in Phase 1
- **Context dependence**: Workflows are templates, not recipes; adapt to your specific situation
- **Tool interaction**: Guides show individual tools but don't fully capture how they interact or conflict
- **Expertise required**: Understanding when to deviate from recommended workflows requires judgment developed through experience
