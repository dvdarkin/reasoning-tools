# Comparative Advantage

**Appears in:** Economics, Organizational Behavior, Military Strategy

## Core Concept

Efficient allocation depends on relative productivity, not absolute. Specialize in tasks where your opportunity cost is lowest relative to others - even if you're not the best in absolute terms. The question isn't "who's best at X?" but "who gives up least to do X?"

## Domain-Specific Variations

### In Economics
- **Context:** International trade and specialization patterns
- **Key operation:** Convert absolute productivity into opportunity cost terms to find comparative advantage

### In Organizational Behavior
- **Context:** Team composition and task allocation
- **Key operation:** Assign based on relative opportunity costs, not just who's most skilled

### In Military Strategy
- **Context:** Force allocation and economy of force
- **Key operation:** Deploy units where their relative advantage is greatest, accept weakness elsewhere

## When to Use This Tool

Use comparative advantage when:
- Allocating tasks in teams or organizations
- Making trade or exchange decisions
- Someone argues "I'm better at everything so I should do everything"
- Optimizing across multiple competing objectives
- Deciding whether to outsource or do in-house

The tool reveals that even being worse at everything doesn't mean you lack productive specialization - you still have comparative advantage in something.
