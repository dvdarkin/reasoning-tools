## Notes

This index identifies reasoning tools that appear across multiple domains with similar names or core concepts. The recurrence suggests these are particularly robust and transferable mental operations.

Tools appearing in many domains tend to be either:
1. **Fundamental structural patterns** (feedback loops, stock-flow)
2. **Core inference techniques** (controlled comparison, randomization)
3. **Essential economic/allocation concepts** (opportunity cost, comparative advantage)
4. **Systematic bias corrections** (base rates, confirmation bias)

These cross-domain tools form a foundational toolkit that applies regardless of specific subject matter.
