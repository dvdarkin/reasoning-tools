# Mental Models / Mental Simulation

**Appears in:** System Dynamics, Military Strategy, Design Thinking

## Core Concept

Before formal modeling or taking action, mentally simulate the system: if this were running, what would happen? Trace through time, following causal chains and feedback loops. Mental simulation surfaces structural errors, missing variables, and implausible assumptions cheaply.

## Domain-Specific Variations

### In System Dynamics
- **Context:** Testing causal loop diagrams and system hypotheses
- **Key operation:** Talk through the system out loud moving through time - where does the narration break down?

### In Military Strategy
- **Context:** Course of action analysis and wargaming
- **Key operation:** Mentally play out the operation - where do plans break under friction?

### In Design Thinking
- **Context:** User journey mapping and prototype testing
- **Key operation:** Simulate the user experience step-by-step before building

## When to Use This Tool

Use mental simulation when:
- Before building formal models (cheaper to catch errors early)
- Planning complex operations with many moving parts
- Evaluating proposed interventions or strategies
- Someone's explanation sounds plausible but you want to test internal consistency
- Debugging by tracing through execution paths

Mental simulation is faster than formal modeling but catches many of the same errors. It's a sanity check, not a replacement for rigorous analysis.
