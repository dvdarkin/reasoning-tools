# Opportunity Cost

**Appears in:** Economics, Operations Research, Resource Allocation, Portfolio Management, Military Strategy

## Core Concept

The true cost of any choice is the value of the best alternative you gave up - not what you paid, but what you forwent. Every resource used for one purpose becomes unavailable for its next-best use.

## Domain-Specific Variations

### In Economics
- **Context:** Foundational concept for understanding trade-offs and allocation decisions
- **Key operation:** For any choice, identify the realistic next-best use of the same resources as your benchmark

### In Operations Research
- **Context:** Bottleneck analysis and constraint optimization
- **Key operation:** Identify binding constraints where opportunity cost is highest - what else could these limited resources accomplish?

### In Portfolio Management
- **Context:** Capital allocation across investment opportunities
- **Key operation:** The cost of holding Asset A is the return foregone from the next-best Asset B

### In Military Strategy
- **Context:** Force deployment and economy of force principle
- **Key operation:** Every unit committed to a secondary objective is unavailable for the primary effort
- **Link:** domains/08-conflict-competition/military-strategy.md#economy-of-force

### In Distributive Justice
- **Context:** Resource allocation in conditions of scarcity
- **Key operation:** Allocating resources to one group means foregoing allocation to other groups

## When to Use This Tool

Use opportunity cost reasoning when:
- Making allocation decisions with scarce resources (time, money, attention, personnel)
- Evaluating sunk costs (which are NOT opportunity costs - they're irrelevant to forward-looking decisions)
- Comparing options where sticker price misleads (free time isn't actually free)
- Someone says "we can't afford not to do X" (forces explicit comparison to alternatives)
- Evaluating career, education, or major life decisions

The tool corrects our tendency to compare choices to "doing nothing" rather than to realistic alternatives.
