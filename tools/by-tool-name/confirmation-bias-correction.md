# Confirmation Bias Correction

**Appears in:** Social Psychology, Experimental Design, Intelligence Analysis, Investigative Journalism, Logic & Critical Thinking

## Core Concept

Systematically seek information that would disconfirm your current hypothesis, not just information that confirms it. Humans naturally seek confirmation, so disconfirmation-seeking must be actively practiced. Only tests that could prove you wrong provide real information.

## Domain-Specific Variations

### In Social Psychology
- **Context:** Wason selection task and hypothesis testing failures
- **Key operation:** For any belief, explicitly generate "what evidence would convince me I'm wrong?" then seek it

### In Experimental Design
- **Context:** Strong inference and falsificationism
- **Key operation:** Design experiments that can definitively reject hypotheses, not just support them
- **Link:** domains/07-truth-seeking/experimental-design.md

### In Intelligence Analysis
- **Context:** Structured analytic techniques like Analysis of Competing Hypotheses
- **Key operation:** Actively look for evidence that would disprove your leading hypothesis
- **Link:** domains/01-decision-under-uncertainty/intelligence-analysis.md

### In Investigative Journalism
- **Context:** Source triangulation and adversarial journalism
- **Key operation:** Interview sources who would disconfirm your story, not just confirm it
- **Link:** domains/07-truth-seeking/investigative-journalism.md

### In Logic & Critical Thinking
- **Context:** Logical fallacies and argument evaluation
- **Key operation:** Steel-man the opposition - generate their strongest counter-arguments
- **Link:** domains/07-truth-seeking/logic-critical-thinking.md

## When to Use This Tool

Use confirmation bias correction when:
- You feel very confident in a hypothesis (overconfidence signals)
- Making important decisions based on accumulated evidence
- Debugging (don't just test cases that confirm your bug hypothesis)
- Evaluating research or arguments
- Someone only presents supporting evidence

The tool is difficult because disconfirmation-seeking feels threatening - it might prove us wrong. That's exactly why it's valuable.
