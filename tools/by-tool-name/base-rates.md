# Base Rates / Prior Probability

**Appears in:** Bayesian Statistics, Intelligence Analysis, Medical Diagnostics, Investigative Journalism

## Core Concept

Before evaluating specific evidence about an individual case, explicitly establish the frequency of the outcome in the appropriate reference class. This base rate anchors your reasoning - evidence moves you from there, but never allows you to completely ignore category frequencies.

## Domain-Specific Variations

### In Bayesian Statistics
- **Context:** Prior probability distribution before observing new evidence
- **Key operation:** Make priors explicit, update proportionally with new evidence, distinguish prior from posterior

### In Intelligence Analysis
- **Context:** Assessing threat probabilities before analyzing specific intelligence
- **Key operation:** Establish baseline rates for events in historical reference classes before evaluating current indicators

### In Medical Diagnostics
- **Context:** Disease prevalence in the relevant population
- **Key operation:** Start with population base rate, adjust for risk factors, then update based on test results

### In Investigative Journalism
- **Context:** How common are false accusations, verified scandals, or errors in the claim type being investigated?
- **Key operation:** Research historical frequency of similar claims being true/false before assessing current evidence

## When to Use This Tool

Use base rate reasoning when:
- Evaluating predictions about individual cases (startup success, disease diagnosis, threat assessment)
- Assessing surprising claims or unusual events
- Interpreting test results or evidence
- Combating the fundamental attribution error or representativeness heuristic
- Someone presents compelling individual details while ignoring category frequencies

The base rate fallacy is among the most robust findings in judgment research - we chronically ignore category frequencies when presented with individuating information.
