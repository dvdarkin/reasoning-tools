# Power Law / Heavy-Tailed Distributions

**Appears in:** Network Science, Economics, Evolutionary Biology, System Dynamics

## Core Concept

Many real-world distributions have heavy tails where a few instances account for the vast majority of the total (80/20 rule, winner-take-all). Most nodes have few connections while rare hubs have millions. Most wealth is held by few people. Most species are rare while few are common. This violates our intuition that expects normal distributions.

## Domain-Specific Variations

### In Network Science
- **Context:** Degree distributions in scale-free networks
- **Key operation:** Check if removing top 10% most-connected nodes fragments the network

### In Economics
- **Context:** Wealth and income inequality, firm size distributions, city populations
- **Key operation:** Recognize when systems exhibit increasing returns and preferential attachment

### In Evolutionary Biology
- **Context:** Species abundance distributions, extinction rates, adaptation sizes
- **Key operation:** Most species are rare specialists; few are abundant generalists

### In System Dynamics
- **Context:** Nonlinearity and threshold effects in complex systems
- **Key operation:** Small changes can have disproportionate effects when near tipping points

## When to Use This Tool

Use power-law thinking when:
- Assuming normal distributions where they don't apply (causes catastrophic prediction errors)
- Systems exhibit preferential attachment or "rich get richer" dynamics
- Planning for tail risks and extreme events
- Allocating attention or resources (focus on vital few, not trivial many)
- Understanding network vulnerabilities (hub networks fail differently than homogeneous networks)

Power laws fundamentally change strategy - from "optimize the average" to "focus on outliers and tail events."
