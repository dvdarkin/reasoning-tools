# Domain Selection Criteria

## Selection Framework

We used a **hybrid matrix approach** to ensure both breadth and practical utility:

**Rows (Problem Domains)** - The utility axis:
1. Decision under uncertainty
2. Persuasion & influence
3. Creative generation
4. Complex system analysis
5. Skill acquisition & mastery
6. Coordination & cooperation
7. Truth-seeking & verification
8. Conflict & competition
9. Resource allocation
10. Pattern recognition

**Columns (Disciplinary Approaches)** - The breadth axis:
- Formal/mathematical
- Empirical/scientific
- Historical/case-based
- Philosophical/normative
- Creative/artistic
- Practical/craft
- Contemplative/introspective

## Extractability Filter

We prioritized **high-extractability** domains for Phase 1:
- ✅ Explicit, documented methodologies
- ✅ Clear literature to draw from
- ✅ Proven track record of application
- ✅ Formalized reasoning techniques

Deferred to future:
- ⚠️ Tacit/implicit knowledge traditions
- ⚠️ Oral traditions with limited documentation
- ⚠️ Highly contested/interpretive frameworks
