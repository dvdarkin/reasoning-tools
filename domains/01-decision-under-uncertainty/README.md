# Decision Under Uncertainty

Reasoning tools for making choices with incomplete information.

## Domains in This Category

1. [Bayesian Statistics](bayesian-statistics.md) - Rigorous framework for updating beliefs with evidence
2. [Meteorology](meteorology.md) - Ensemble forecasting, confidence intervals, model averaging
3. [Intelligence Analysis](intelligence-analysis.md) - Structured analytic techniques, red teaming
4. [Emergency Medicine](emergency-medicine.md) - Triage, protocols, rapid assessment under pressure

## Common Themes

- Quantifying uncertainty explicitly
- Updating beliefs with new evidence
- Avoiding overconfidence
- Working with probabilistic information
- Making decisions before full information is available

## Cross-Domain Tools

Tools that appear across multiple domains in this category:
- Base rate reasoning
