# Complex Systems

Reasoning tools for understanding interconnected, dynamic systems.

## Domains in This Category

1. **System Dynamics** - Stock-flow thinking, feedback loops, delays, nonlinear effects
2. **Network Science** - Network structure, centrality, cascades, small-world effects
3. **Ecology** - Interdependence, trophic cascades, resilience, ecosystem services
4. **Accident Investigation** - Root cause analysis, Swiss cheese model, systemic factors

## Common Themes

- Thinking in feedback loops and interconnections
- Recognizing emergence and nonlinear effects
- Identifying leverage points and system archetypes
- Understanding delays and accumulation
- Mapping causal chains and interaction effects

## Cross-Domain Tools

Tools that appear across multiple domains in this category:
- Stock-flow distinction
- Feedback loops (reinforcing and balancing)
- Time delays and accumulation
- Leverage points
- Network effects and cascades
