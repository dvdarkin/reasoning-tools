# Pattern Recognition

Reasoning tools for identifying patterns, making classifications, and generating predictions.

## Domains in This Category

1. [Machine Learning](machine-learning.md) - Feature engineering, overfitting, bias-variance tradeoff, cross-validation
2. [Medical Diagnostics](medical-diagnostics.md) - Differential diagnosis, Bayesian reasoning, decision trees, heuristics

## Common Themes

- Building and testing pattern libraries
- Balancing sensitivity with specificity
- Avoiding overfitting to noise
- Using statistical vs clinical reasoning
- Learning from labeled examples

## Cross-Domain Tools

Tools that appear across multiple domains in this category:
- Differential diagnosis and hypothesis generation
- Feature selection and dimensionality reduction
- Cross-validation and out-of-sample testing
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Base rate integration
