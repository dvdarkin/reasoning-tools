# Core Economics: Foundational Reasoning Tools

The mental operations that underlie economic thinking - the primitives that transfer across any domain involving scarcity, choice, and trade-offs.

---

## Why Core Economics Generates Useful Thinking Tools

Economics has earned skepticism. Models that assume perfect rationality, complete information, and frictionless markets often fail spectacularly when applied to reality. The 2008 financial crisis, the replication crisis in behavioral research, and decades of failed development interventions all testify to the limits of economic theorizing.

Yet embedded within economics are reasoning tools that remain useful even when the theories fail. These aren't models of how the world works - they're structured ways of asking questions. "Compared to what?" forces you to consider alternatives you'd otherwise ignore. "What's the binding constraint?" directs attention to the actual bottleneck. "Who bears the cost?" reveals hidden stakeholders. These operations work whether markets are efficient or not, whether agents are rational or not.

The extraction principle is this: separate the questioning structure from the theoretical baggage. Opportunity cost thinking doesn't require believing in homo economicus. Marginal analysis works even when people don't actually optimize. The tools are about disciplining your own thinking, not predicting others' behavior.

Core economics contains the foundational primitives - the moves that show up in almost every economic analysis. Strategic interaction, information problems, and behavioral deviations are treated in companion extractions. Start here.

## Tier 1: Foundational Primitives

These are the atomic reasoning moves. Every other economic tool builds on these foundations.

---

### Opportunity Cost

**What**: The true cost of any choice is the value of the best alternative you gave up. Not what you paid - what you forwent. Every choice has an opportunity cost, even when no money changes hands.

**Why it matters**: Sticker prices lie. Time is unpriced. Attention is unpriced. Most decisions look entirely different when you ask "compared to what?" This single question reveals hidden costs that naive accounting misses. The PhD costs five years of foregone salary, not just tuition. The meeting costs every other use of that hour. The relationship costs other relationships you're not forming. Opportunity cost thinking forces you to evaluate choices against their actual alternatives, not against zero.

**The key move**: For any choice under consideration, identify the realistic next-best use of the same resources (time, money, attention, capacity). Compare the choice not to doing nothing, but to that specific alternative. If you can't articulate the alternative, you don't understand your constraints. The operative question is always: "What am I giving up to do this?"

**Classic application**: Capital budgeting. A company evaluates projects not just on absolute returns but on returns relative to other uses of capital. A 10% return is good or bad depending on what else is available. A factory built here can't be built there. The opportunity cost of capital is what that capital would earn in its next-best use.

**Surprising application**: Personal relationship decisions. The opportunity cost of staying in a mediocre relationship isn't being alone - it's the other relationships you could form with that time and emotional energy. The opportunity cost of attending every family gathering is the friendships you're not building. Makes clear why "better than nothing" is insufficient reasoning - the comparison class matters.

**Failure modes**:
- Comparing to "doing nothing" when that's not a real option - there's always an alternative use of resources
- Treating sunk costs as relevant - opportunity cost is forward-looking; what you've already spent creates no future alternatives
- Ignoring optionality value in alternatives - some alternatives preserve future options, which is itself valuable
- Paralysis from infinite alternatives - you need to identify the realistic next-best option, not enumerate all possibilities
- Ignoring transaction costs - switching to the alternative has costs that may exceed the opportunity cost of staying

**Go deeper**: Buchanan's "Cost and Choice" for the philosophical foundations - cost is subjective and exists only at the moment of decision. Bastiat's "What is Seen and What is Not Seen" for the original articulation of hidden costs.

---

### Marginal Thinking

**What**: Decisions happen at the margin. Not "is X good" but "is one more unit of X worth the cost of one more unit, given current levels." Almost nothing is binary - the interesting question is usually "how much," and the answer changes based on where you already are.

**Why it matters**: Average thinking misleads. The average cost of your product doesn't tell you whether to make one more unit. The average benefit of exercise doesn't tell you whether another hour in the gym helps. What matters is the marginal - the change in outcomes from the next increment. And critically, margins shift. The tenth cookie is less valuable than the first. The tenth hour of work is harder than the first. Optimization is finding where marginal benefit equals marginal cost.

**The key move**: Ask what changes with one more unit. Benefits typically diminish (diminishing marginal utility). Costs often increase (increasing marginal cost). The optimal point is where these cross - where the next unit costs exactly what it's worth. Never ask "is this valuable?" Ask "is the next increment valuable given current levels?"

**Classic application**: Production decisions. Firms don't ask "should we make widgets?" They ask "should we make one more widget given what we're already producing?" A firm making 100 widgets asks whether the 101st is worth its cost. The answer depends on current production levels - the marginal cost of the 101st unit might be much higher than the average cost of the first 100.

**Surprising application**: Relationships. Not "is this friendship good" but "is the next hour invested in this friendship worth more than the next hour invested elsewhere, given current investment levels." A friendship where you've invested little has high marginal returns. One where you've invested heavily may have diminishing returns. This isn't cynical - it's recognizing that relationships have different marginal values at different investment levels.

**Failure modes**:
- Using averages when you need marginals - average cost ≠ marginal cost
- Ignoring that margins shift as quantities change - today's marginal value isn't tomorrow's
- Treating discrete decisions as if they were continuous - sometimes choices really are binary
- Confusing total value with marginal value - something can have high total value but low marginal value if you already have enough
- Ignoring interdependencies - the marginal value of X may depend on how much Y you have

**Go deeper**: Any intermediate microeconomics text covers this formally. Marshall's "Principles of Economics" for the historical development of marginalist thinking.

### Trade-offs and Constraints

**What**: Scarcity forces choice. You can't have everything. Every system operates within constraints - budgets, time, physics, attention, political capital. Acknowledging this isn't pessimism; it's the prerequisite for intelligent decision-making.

**Why it matters**: Wishful thinking ignores constraints. Effective reasoning identifies the binding constraint and works within or around it. Most organizational failures come from optimizing against the wrong constraint or pretending constraints don't exist. The binding constraint is where additional resources would actually help. Loosening non-binding constraints is waste.

**The key move**: For any objective, ask: what limits progress? Is it money, time, information, coordination, legitimacy, attention? Find the binding constraint - the one that, if relaxed, would actually improve outcomes. Then either work within it, work to relax it, or reframe the objective. Never pretend constraints don't exist.

**Classic application**: Budget constraints in consumer choice. You maximize utility subject to your budget, not in the abstract. You can't afford everything you want, so you trade off. The constraint shapes the choice.

**Surprising application**: Organizational strategy. Most organizations are bottlenecked by one or two binding constraints - often attention of key decision-makers. Adding engineers doesn't help if the constraint is product direction. Adding money doesn't help if the constraint is organizational capacity. Identifying the actual bottleneck is most of the strategic work.

**Failure modes**:
- Optimizing against non-binding constraints - adding resources where they don't help
- Treating all constraints as fixed when some are negotiable - constraints have costs to relax, but they're not immutable
- Ignoring that relieving one constraint often reveals another - there's always a next binding constraint
- Confusing constraints with preferences - "we can't do X" often means "we prefer not to do X"
- Treating trade-offs as problems to solve rather than realities to navigate - you can't optimize your way out of scarcity

### Comparative Advantage

**What**: Efficient allocation depends on relative productivity, not absolute. You should specialize in tasks where your opportunity cost is lowest relative to others - even if you're not the best in absolute terms. The best use of your time is determined by comparison, not by your absolute abilities.

**Why it matters**: Absolute thinking leads to bad allocation. The best programmer shouldn't debug if their comparative advantage is architecture, even if they're also the best debugger. A country that's worse at everything still has comparative advantage in something. Trade benefits both parties when each specializes in their comparative advantage.

**The key move**: Don't ask "who's best at X." Ask "who gives up least to do X." Convert absolute productivity into opportunity cost terms. The person with comparative advantage in task A is the one whose opportunity cost (what they give up by doing A instead of B) is lowest.

**Classic application**: International trade. A country that's more productive at everything still benefits from trade. If the US is twice as productive at making cars and three times as productive at making computers, it should specialize in computers and import cars. Portugal should make wine even if England could make it more efficiently, because England's comparative advantage is in cloth.

**Surprising application**: Team composition. A founder who can do everything should still delegate based on comparative advantage. The question isn't what they can do, but what costs them least relative to others. A CEO who's good at coding still shouldn't code if their comparative advantage is fundraising - even if they're better at coding than their engineers.

**Failure modes**:
- Assigning tasks to whoever is "best" in absolute terms - this ignores what they're giving up
- Ignoring transaction costs of coordination and trade - specialization has overhead
- Forgetting that comparative advantage can shift with investment - today's disadvantage can become tomorrow's advantage
- Treating comparative advantage as static - it changes as skills and circumstances change
- Ignoring economies of scale and scope that complicate the simple story

### Equilibrium as Analytical Tool

**What**: A situation is in equilibrium when no agent has incentive to unilaterally change their behavior. This isn't a prediction that systems reach equilibrium - it's a consistency check on your reasoning. If your model has someone leaving money on the table indefinitely, you're missing something.

**Why it matters**: Equilibrium thinking is a debugging tool for your analysis. If your story about a situation implies that someone could benefit by changing behavior and isn't, either you've missed something about their constraints, or your model is wrong. Equilibrium analysis finds where behavior is mutually consistent.

**The key move**: For any proposed outcome, ask: given what everyone else is doing, does anyone want to deviate? If yes, trace where deviations lead. If no, you've found a stable configuration. Use this to check whether your model of a situation is internally consistent.

**Classic application**: Market clearing. Price adjusts until quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. At that point, no buyer or seller wants to change behavior. If the price is above equilibrium, there's excess supply and sellers will cut prices. If below, there's excess demand and prices rise.

**Surprising application**: Social norms. A norm persists when everyone following it is individually rational given that others follow it. Norm change requires coordinated deviation. This explains why norms can be stable for long periods then shift rapidly - they're equilibria that depend on expectations about others' behavior.

**Failure modes**:
- Assuming systems actually reach equilibrium - they often don't; equilibrium is a theoretical construct
- Ignoring multiple equilibria - different stable configurations are possible; history matters
- Confusing equilibrium with optimality - stable doesn't mean good; bad equilibria exist
- Treating equilibrium as static - equilibria can shift when parameters change
- Ignoring the path to equilibrium - transition dynamics matter, and systems can get stuck

## Tier 2: Resource Allocation

Tools for understanding how resources get allocated and why outcomes diverge from intentions.

---

### Incentive Mapping

**What**: Agents respond to actual incentives, not intended ones. The behavior a system produces is the behavior it rewards. To understand outcomes, trace the incentive structure as it actually exists.

**Why it matters**: Systems routinely produce outcomes their designers didn't want because the incentive structure rewards something else. Diagnosing this requires mapping incentives as they are, not as hoped. "Why does this keep happening?" is usually answered by "What does this system actually reward?"

**The key move**: For any system, identify what actions are rewarded, what's punished, who monitors, and what the monitors' incentives are. Then predict behavior that maximizes reward within those rules. The behavior you get is the behavior you're paying for.

**Classic application**: Compensation design. Salespeople paid on revenue maximize revenue, not profit. Employees measured on lines of code write verbose code. Teachers evaluated on test scores teach to the test. The system produces exactly what it measures.

**Surprising application**: Content recommendation. Algorithms optimizing for engagement produce outrage because outrage engages. The system is working exactly as designed, just not as intended. The recommendation engine's incentive is maximizing clicks - if outrage maximizes clicks, outrage is what you get.

**Failure modes**:
- Assuming agents share your objectives - they respond to their incentives, not your wishes
- Ignoring that measurement itself shapes behavior (Goodhart's law) - when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure
- Forgetting that monitors need incentives too - who watches the watchers?
- Treating stated incentives as actual incentives - official rewards often differ from real ones
- Ignoring non-monetary incentives - status, autonomy, meaning all drive behavior

---

### Externalities

**What**: When an action imposes costs or benefits on parties not involved in the decision, private optimization diverges from social optimum. The decision-maker doesn't bear all costs or capture all benefits, so their optimal choice differs from the collectively optimal choice.

**Why it matters**: Externalities are everywhere - pollution, noise, network effects, herd immunity, education, research. Recognizing them identifies where uncoordinated action fails and where intervention might help. They explain the gap between individual rationality and collective welfare.

**The key move**: For any activity, ask: who bears costs or receives benefits outside the decision-maker? The gap between private and social cost/benefit indicates over- or under-production. Negative externalities mean overproduction. Positive externalities mean underproduction.

**Classic application**: Pollution. Factory owners don't pay for the air quality damage they impose. They bear private costs (materials, labor) but not social costs (health impacts on neighbors). Result: too much pollution relative to social optimum. The factory optimizes for itself, ignoring costs it imposes on others.

**Surprising application**: Positive externalities in knowledge production. Inventors can't capture all value from their inventions - others learn and build on them. The inventor bears the full cost of R&D but captures only a fraction of the benefit. Result: underinvestment in research relative to social optimum.

**Failure modes**:
- Treating all third-party effects as externalities - distinguish pecuniary (through prices) from technological (direct) externalities
- Assuming externalities require intervention - sometimes Coase theorem conditions hold and parties can bargain to efficiency
- Ignoring that remedies have costs and create their own distortions - the cure can be worse than the disease
- Treating externalities as binary - they're a matter of degree
- Ignoring that what counts as an externality depends on how property rights are defined

---

### Public Goods and Collective Action

**What**: When goods are non-excludable (can't prevent non-payers from enjoying) and non-rival (one person's use doesn't reduce another's), private provision fails. Free-riding is rational, so voluntary contributions are insufficient.

**Why it matters**: Defense, basic research, clean air, open-source software, public parks - these are systematically underprovided by markets. Understanding why points to what institutional structures can help. The free-rider problem isn't a moral failure - it's a structural feature of certain goods.

**The key move**: For any good, ask: can non-payers be excluded? Does use by one reduce availability for others? If neither (non-excludable and non-rival), it's a public good. Expect underprovision through voluntary action and look for institutional solutions.

**Classic application**: National defense. Your protection doesn't reduce your neighbor's (non-rival). You can't exclude non-payers within the territory (non-excludable). Free-riding is rational - why pay when you get protected anyway? Private provision fails. Hence public provision through taxes.

**Surprising application**: Social movements and protests. Participation has private costs (time, risk). Benefits are non-excludable (everyone gets the policy change if it succeeds). Free-riding is rational. Yet protests happen - explained by selective incentives (social belonging), identity benefits, and expressive value beyond instrumental outcomes.

**Failure modes**:
- Treating all shared resources as public goods - most are either excludable (club goods) or rival (common pool resources)
- Ignoring that some collective action problems get solved - Ostrom's work on commons governance shows communities can self-organize
- Assuming government provision is always the answer - government has its own failures
- Treating the free-rider problem as a moral issue rather than a structural one
- Ignoring partial solutions like assurance contracts, matching grants, and social pressure

---

### Elasticity Thinking

**What**: Elasticity measures responsiveness - how much does one thing change when another changes? The elasticity of demand measures how much quantity demanded changes when price changes. High elasticity means high sensitivity; low elasticity means behavior barely changes.

**Why it matters**: Not all responses are equal. Raising prices 10% might cut demand 30% (elastic) or 2% (inelastic). The difference is everything for strategy, policy, and prediction. Elasticity determines who bears costs, whether policies work, and how systems respond to shocks.

**The key move**: Whenever you're considering a change (price, policy, input), ask: how responsive is behavior to this change? This isn't just "will people respond?" but "how much will they respond?" A 1% change in X causes what percent change in Y?

**Classic application**: Tax incidence. When you tax a good, who actually pays - buyers or sellers? It depends on elasticity. If demand is inelastic (buyers can't easily substitute), buyers bear most of the tax. If supply is inelastic (sellers can't easily exit), sellers bear most. The statutory incidence (who writes the check) differs from economic incidence (who actually pays).

**Surprising application**: Time horizons and responsiveness. Demand for gasoline is inelastic in the short run (you can't instantly change your car or commute) but more elastic in the long run (you can buy a different car, move closer to work). Most goods are more elastic long-run than short-run. Elasticity changes with timeframe.

**Failure modes**:
- Treating all responses as equal - sensitivity varies enormously across goods, people, and contexts
- Ignoring that elasticity changes at different price points - demand may be elastic at high prices but inelastic at low prices
- Confusing short-run and long-run elasticity - responsiveness takes time
- Treating elasticity as fixed - it depends on available substitutes, which change over time
- Ignoring cross-elasticities - how responsive is demand for X when the price of Y changes?

**Go deeper**: Any intermediate microeconomics text covers elasticity formally. The empirical literature on specific elasticities (labor supply, demand for healthcare, etc.) is more useful than the theory.

---

### Pareto Efficiency

**What**: A situation is Pareto efficient when no one can be made better off without making someone else worse off. It's a minimal criterion for efficiency - if a change could help someone without hurting anyone, we should make it. But Pareto efficiency says nothing about fairness or distribution.

**Why it matters**: Pareto efficiency separates the "can we do better?" question from the "how should we distribute?" question. A Pareto improvement is unambiguously good - everyone consents because no one is hurt. But many situations are Pareto efficient yet deeply unfair. The concept clarifies what efficiency means and what it doesn't.

**The key move**: When evaluating a change, ask: is there a way to make someone better off without making anyone worse off? If yes, the current situation isn't Pareto efficient - there are unrealized gains. If no, you've reached the Pareto frontier, and further changes involve trade-offs between people.

**Classic application**: Gains from trade. If I value your apple more than my orange, and you value my orange more than your apple, trade makes us both better off. Before trade, the situation wasn't Pareto efficient - there were unrealized gains.

**Surprising application**: Institutional design. Many disputes are about distribution along the Pareto frontier, not about reaching it. Once you've exhausted Pareto improvements, every change helps some and hurts others. Recognizing this separates efficiency arguments from distribution arguments.

**Failure modes**:
- Treating Pareto efficiency as sufficient for good outcomes - a world where one person has everything is Pareto efficient
- Ignoring that reaching the Pareto frontier often requires compensation mechanisms
- Confusing Pareto efficiency with other efficiency concepts (productive, allocative, dynamic)
- Using Pareto reasoning to block any change that hurts anyone - this privileges the status quo
- Ignoring transaction costs of making Pareto improvements

**Go deeper**: Any welfare economics text covers this. Amartya Sen's critiques of Paretian welfare economics are essential reading.

---

### Rent-Seeking vs Value Creation

**What**: Rent-seeking is competing for a larger share of existing value without creating new value. Value creation expands the total pie. Many activities that look productive are actually rent-seeking - zero-sum redistribution disguised as production.

**Why it matters**: An economy where everyone is rent-seeking produces nothing. The distinction clarifies which activities make society richer and which just redistribute. Lawyers who write clearer contracts create value; lawyers who write deliberately ambiguous contracts that generate litigation are rent-seeking.

**The key move**: For any activity that appears profitable, ask: is this expanding the pie or fighting for a larger slice? Does this activity create value that didn't exist, or capture value that would exist anyway? The private return may be high while the social return is zero or negative.

**Classic application**: Lobbying. Companies spend billions lobbying for favorable regulations, tax breaks, and subsidies. The private return can be enormous (dollars of tax breaks per dollar lobbied). But the social return is negative - resources spent influencing redistribution, not creating value.

**Surprising application**: Credential inflation. When everyone gets a college degree, the signaling value diminishes but the cost remains. Resources spent on credentials beyond what's needed for productivity is rent-seeking - competing for position without expanding total productivity.

**Failure modes**:
- Treating all profit as value creation - private returns don't equal social returns
- Treating all competition as rent-seeking - competition often creates value through innovation and efficiency
- Ignoring that the distinction can be fuzzy - some activities are partly value creation, partly rent-seeking
- Assuming rent-seeking is always intentional - people may not realize their activity is zero-sum
- Ignoring that some rent-seeking can't be eliminated and must be managed

**Go deeper**: Tullock's original work on rent-seeking. Krueger's work on rent-seeking in development contexts.

---

### Substitutes and Complements

**What**: Substitutes are goods that compete - if you use more of one, you need less of the other (coffee vs tea). Complements reinforce each other - using more of one increases the value of the other (coffee and cream). This structure determines how systems respond to changes.

**Why it matters**: Whether goods are substitutes or complements determines how demand responds, how pricing strategies work, and how markets interact. If your product is a complement to something popular, ride the wave. If it's a substitute, you're competing directly.

**The key move**: For any two activities or goods, ask: does more of one increase or decrease the value of the other? If doing A makes B less valuable, they're substitutes. If doing A makes B more valuable, they're complements. This determines strategic implications.

**Classic application**: Platform strategy. iOS apps are complements to iPhones. More good apps make iPhones more valuable. Apple's strategy rationally subsidizes app development (through developer tools, App Store promotion) because apps are complements to its hardware.

**Surprising application**: Work and leisure skills. Many leisure activities are substitutes for work (you do one or the other). But some are complements - exercise that increases energy, reading that builds skills, relationships that provide support. Structuring leisure as complementary to work rather than substituting for it changes its value.

**Failure modes**:
- Treating all alternatives as substitutes - some alternatives are actually complements at the system level
- Ignoring that substitute/complement relationships can change - goods that were substitutes can become complements with new technology
- Missing indirect relationships - goods can be complements to something that's a substitute to your product
- Treating the relationship as symmetric - A might be a stronger substitute for B than B is for A
- Ignoring network effects that can turn substitutes into winner-take-all competition

**Go deeper**: Standard microeconomics texts cover this. Platform economics literature (Rochet and Tirole) develops the strategic implications.

## Usage Notes

These tools are lenses for seeing, not laws of behavior. They structure your questions but don't guarantee correct answers.

**Domain of applicability**: These tools work best when resources are genuinely scarce and trade-offs are real. They work less well for situations involving genuine abundance, intrinsic motivation, or moral considerations that shouldn't be traded off.

**Limitations**: Economic reasoning can become reductive. Not everything is a trade-off. Not all value can be compared. These tools tell you how to think about allocation problems - they don't tell you which problems to frame as allocation problems.

**Composition**: Opportunity cost and marginal thinking combine naturally - the marginal opportunity cost of the next unit. Incentive mapping and equilibrium combine - trace incentives to predict stable configurations. Public goods and externalities often appear together - a public good is an extreme case of positive externality.

**Integration**: These core tools complement information economics (what happens with asymmetric information) and behavioral economics (what happens when agents deviate from rationality). Master these foundations before adding complications.
