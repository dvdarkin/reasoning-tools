# Truth-Seeking & Verification

Reasoning tools for distinguishing truth from falsehood and validating claims.

## Domains in This Category

1. **Formal Verification** - Proofs, invariants, model checking, formal specifications
2. **Experimental Design** - Control groups, randomization, blinding, statistical power
3. **Investigative Journalism** - Source verification, triangulation, paper trails
4. **Logic & Critical Thinking** - Valid inference, fallacy detection, argument structure

## Common Themes
