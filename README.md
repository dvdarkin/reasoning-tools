# Reasoning Tools Knowledge Base

A comprehensive, structured library of transferable reasoning tools extracted from 32 high-value domains.

## What This Is

This is a collection of **reasoning primitives** - mental operations that transfer across domains. Not facts, not theories, but thinking tools that remain useful even when specific models are wrong.

Each tool includes:
- **What**: The core concept
- **Why it matters**: What problem it solves
- **The key move**: The actual mental operation
- **Classic application**: Where it originated
- **Surprising application**: Evidence it transfers
- **Failure modes**: When it misleads
- **Go deeper**: Citations to serious literature

These tools were extracted separately from each domain's literature, yet converged on the same core mental operation—strong evidence they represent genuine reasoning primitives rather than domain-specific techniques.

## Selection Criteria

Domains were selected using a **hybrid matrix approach** balancing:
- **Breadth**: Coverage across disciplinary approaches (formal, empirical, historical, philosophical, creative, practical, contemplative)
- **Utility**: Coverage across problem domains (decision-making, persuasion, creativity, etc.)
- **Extractability**: Explicit, documented methodologies with clear literature

Phase 1 focused on **high-extractability** domains:
- Explicit, documented methodologies
- Clear literature to draw from
- Proven track record of application
- Formalized reasoning techniques

See [meta/domain-selection-criteria.md](meta/domain-selection-criteria.md) for detailed rationale.

## Quality Standards

All extractions follow consistent quality criteria:
- **Clear mental operations** - Not just concepts, but actionable thinking moves
- **Evidence of transfer** - Surprising applications in different domains
- **Honest failure modes** - Specific scenarios where tools mislead
- **Academic citations** - Serious literature, not pop science

See [meta/quality-criteria.md](meta/quality-criteria.md) for full checklist.

## How to Use

1. **Start with a problem**: "I need to make a decision with incomplete information"
2. **Find relevant domains**: Browse [Decision Under Uncertainty](domains/01-decision-under-uncertainty/README.md)
3. **Learn the tools**: Read 1-2 domains that resonate (Bayesian Statistics, Intelligence Analysis)
4. **Try the key moves**: Apply the mental operations to your problem
5. **Watch for failure modes**: Know when the tool misleads

**Example workflow:**
- Problem: Evaluating a business opportunity with uncertain market demand
- Domains: Bayesian Statistics (base rates, updating), Intelligence Analysis (red teaming), Economics (opportunity cost)
- Key moves: Identify reference class → assign prior → gather evidence → update beliefs → consider alternatives
- Failure modes: Availability bias in selecting reference class, overconfidence after early confirming evidence

## Known Limitations

**Link Format Compatibility:**
- Internal links use GitHub-style anchors (kebab-case slugs, e.g., `#comparative-advantage` for heading `## Comparative Advantage`)
- These anchors work on **GitHub** and most markdown renderers, but not **Obsidian**
- Obsidian uses a different anchor format - links will open the file but not scroll to the section ([known incompatibility](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/support-gfm-style-kebab-case-heading-slug-anchor-targets/30350))
- See [tools/glossary.md](tools/glossary.md) for a complete alphabetical index of all tools with verified links
